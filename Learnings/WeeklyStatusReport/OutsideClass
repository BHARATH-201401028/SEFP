I Completed few View/pages required for the app.Looked through some interesting Videos on Android Studio.
But still trying to implement to implement Databases in Android Studio.Hopefully I can complete it by 2 days more from today.

Week7 and Week 8:
To be frank I was very busy in other works (courses).
But I need to mention this I am trying lonely to complete my project.
I completed views pages in Android  Studio
I integrated Databases but its not working now I need to find  another account and host database their and give the database Host link to 
the App and complete the procedure of the registration.
I am trying to do backend till then.forgot to mention I wrote a review paper for 35 marks I submitted it last week.
Basically I am learing databases integration with Android Studio still.I regret myself and I curse myself in doing the same work all
 the last 3 week.
